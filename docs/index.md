# Gesso <small>for WordPress (w/ Timber)</small>

## About Gesso

Gesso is a [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)-based starter theme that outputs
accessible HTML5 markup. It uses a mobile-first responsive approach and
leverages [SMACSS](https://smacss.com/) for style organization. This
encourages a component-based approach to theming through the creation of
discrete, reusable UI elements. It is heavily integrated with [Pattern Lab](http://patternlab.io/), allowing WordPress and Pattern Lab to share the same markup.

Gesso (pronounced JEH-so) is an art term for the white paint mixture used to prepare a canvas or sculpture for painting. Likewise, the Gesso starter theme prepares WordPress frontend markup and styles to give us a clean starting point. This is the [WordPress](https://github.com/forumone/gesso-wp) port of it's [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/project/gesso) version where the theme was first created.

## About Timber

[Timber Library](https://upstatement.com/timber/) is a WordPress plugin and a dependency for this theme. It provides the [Twig Template Engine](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/doc/templates.html) to the WordPress context for you create fully-customized themes faster with more sustainable code.

## About Twig
[Twig](https://twig.symfony.com) is a modern template engine for PHP. It allows you to write your HTML separate from your PHP files. This cleans-up your theme code so your PHP file can focus on supplying the data and logic, while your twig file can focus 100% on the display and HTML.
